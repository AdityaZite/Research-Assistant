Kidney disease is a major health concern, affecting a large population of people and has led to high mortality rates worldwide. Detection at earlier stages in kidney disease is important for its management, as it can slow down or even prevent disease progression. However, routine diagnostic tests, such as serum creatinine tests and renal biopsies, are often invasive, time- consuming, and prone to human error. Due to this, a surge in demand for more accurate, automated, and non-invasive methods of diagnosis. In recent years, advancements in machine learning and deep learning have led way for more sophisticated diagnostic tools. Convolutional Neural Network, a subset of deep learning models designed for image data processing, have shown exceptional performance in medical imaging tasks, such as tumor detection, retinal disease classification, and lung disease identification. By leveraging CNNs for kidney disease detection, we can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the need for invasiveprocedures. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based framework for the detection and classification of kidney diseases using medical image data, such as computed tomography scans. The proposed model is trained to identify patterns in kidney images that are indicative of either normal kidney or tumor.
